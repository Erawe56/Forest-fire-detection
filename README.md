# Forest-fire-detection

This project works on forest fire detection using data science techniques. The major objective is to build a model which will be able to predict the forest fires and thereby help the authority to declare caution in vulnerable areas with some environmental factors. If we could give better information about forest fires, this would help in early detection and maybe prevent large scale damages of forests and surrounding councils.

Key Features

Data Collection: We collect data from different sources like weather data, fire data, historical fire report, and factors of the environment.

Data Preprocessing : Performed data cleaning and processing in order to be suitable for analysis. It involved missing values, Normalisation and Feature engineering.

Model Development: Implemented YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once version 8) to detect the likelihood of forest fires from image data. YOLOv8 is a state-of-the-art object detection model known for its speed and accuracy.

Evaluation: Evaluated the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure that the model performs well.
